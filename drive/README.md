**Software:** SolveSpace 3.1

Mounting bracket/adapter for a 2.5" drive to be mounted on a 3.5" drive bottom mount slot.

The 2.5" drive can be attached to the bracket with either the side or bottom mounts (or both if you really want to).

Screws needed:

- **M3** for 2.5" drive. The holes on the adapter for the 2.5" drive will allow M3 screw "stems" to pass through them and are not meant to be screwed into.
- **6-32** for 3.5" drive bottom mount slot. The holes for these have to be screwed into.
